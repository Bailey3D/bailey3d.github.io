I"|<p>These are a series of tools in unreal focused around procedural creation and placement of geometry and environmental details. 
They were all created using a mix of Blueprint and C++.</p>

<p>The main benefit to interactive procedural tools like this is the time cost saving it creates, taking processes which would typically be full tasks and turning them into simple-to-do processes.</p>

<p>Procedural and modular bookcase system. Again all unique meshes are instanced, and a single shader is used for all pieces. The system uses 8 unique bookcase pieces along with the shelf and door, meaning the whole system uses 10 draw calls. System is parameterized with settings such as: RowsCount, ColumsCount and bUseDrawers. This system helped to save a lot of time and avoid art fatigue within the library scene along with improving the scenes overall performance.</p>
