I":<p>Surface shader created in Unreal Engine, simulating the specular lighting effect commonly seen on iridescent surfaces (Beetles, Oil, etc.), with an additional light-wrap effect for visual flair.</p>

<hr />

<p>In this project I aimed to create a minimal dependency Iridescent effect shader.</p>

<p>Iridescent surfaces are found on lots of different surfaces in nature (Eg, Oil, Beetle Shells, Titanium)</p>

<p>The shader uses a custom lightwrap based on a world space 3D noise, and doesnâ€™t depend on any light positions. This has the advantage of working on virtually any surface, but the disadvantage of not being physically correct.</p>

<p><strong>Input Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Iridescent Tint: The base tint of the iridescent effect</li>
  <li>Range: The overall colour range the iridescent gradient extends over (1.0 = full RGB range, 0.5 = base tint -&gt; base tint + 0.5 hue)</li>
  <li>Scale: The overall scale of the 3D noise used with the lightwrap function</li>
  <li>Fresnel Strength: An additional colour bump when viewed at grazing angles</li>
</ul>

<p>The Noise map is a low resolution 3D Perlin Noise texture, which is combined with a custom lightwrap UV function to simulate the iridescent effect when moving around the surface.</p>
