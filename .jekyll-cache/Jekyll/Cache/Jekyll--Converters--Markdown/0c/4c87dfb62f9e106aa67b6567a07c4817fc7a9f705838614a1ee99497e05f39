I"<p>Riverside camp in an Oak Forest, created in just over a week.</p>

<p>Focusing on a more natural/non-hard surface environment for this piece.</p>

<p>The location went through a few iterations, but eventually I decided on a riverside, to give a more neutral time-frame and feel to the environment, and focus more on aesthetics.</p>

<p>A mix of Procedural materials (In Substance Designer) and Image-to-material (For Foliage/Leaves) was used throughout the scene.</p>
