I"Ø<p>This is a shader function which can be added to any PBR surface to add an interactive iridescent effect (with colours changing depending on view angle).</p>

<p>It was designed to be as minimal as possible, meaning it can be applied to pretty much any surface. This has the advantage of being plug and play, and works within a regular deferred pass, but the disadvantage ob being only a simulation meaning weâ€™re not calculating physically accurate diffraction.</p>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>The effect is fully parameterized so we can add it to any surface, the parameters are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> This controls the overall scale of the 3D noise used for the light wrapping and breakup affect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Colour Range:</strong> A [0..1] value which is used for the maximum hue shift allowed by the effect. 1.0 will result in a full colour spectrum (starting at the input tint), whereas 0.0 will result in only the tint being used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tint:</strong> The starting tint for the colour of the iridescent effect (Note, this also controls the overall saturation and lightness of the colours)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fresnel Effect Strength:</strong> When viewed from grazing angles the iridescent hue shift is always bumped up to max. This controls how visible the fresnel effect is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Noise Texture 3D:</strong> A 3D Texture sample used for the lightwrap and breakup effect. This defaults to a low-res 3D perlin noise texture, which works for most cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
