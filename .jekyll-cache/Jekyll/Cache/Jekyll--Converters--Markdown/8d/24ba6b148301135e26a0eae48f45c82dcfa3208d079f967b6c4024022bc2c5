I"š<p>This is a shader function which can be added to any PBR surface to add an interactive iridescent effect (with colours changing depending on view angle).</p>

<p>It was designed to be as minimal as possible, meaning it can be applied to pretty much any surface. This has the advantage of being plug and play, and works within a regular deferred pass, but the disadvantage ob being only a simulation meaning weâ€™re not calculating physically accurate diffraction.</p>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>The effect is fully parameterized so we can add it to any surface, the parameters are listed below:</p>

<h2 id="quick-breakdown">Quick Breakdown</h2>

<p><strong>Input Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Iridescent Tint: The base tint of the iridescent effect</li>
  <li>Range: The overall colour range the iridescent gradient extends over (1.0 = full RGB range, 0.5 = base tint -&gt; base tint + 0.5 hue)</li>
  <li>Scale: The overall scale of the 3D noise used with the lightwrap function</li>
  <li>Fresnel Strength: An additional colour bump when viewed at grazing angles</li>
</ul>

<p>The Noise map is a low resolution 3D Perlin Noise texture, which is combined with a custom lightwrap UV function to simulate the iridescent effect when moving around the surface.</p>
