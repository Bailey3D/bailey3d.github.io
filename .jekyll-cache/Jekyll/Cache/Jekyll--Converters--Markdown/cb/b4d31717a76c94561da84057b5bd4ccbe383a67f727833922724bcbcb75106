I"p<p>Asset Library is a series of pipeline tools and standardizations I’ve implemented into my own personal game projects, with a few main goals, all focused on maximizing the efficiency of taking content from various DCC Packages to the final Game.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat personal solution to asset management for my own work, and is constantly evolving. But since it’s starting to morph into a more tangible pipeline and set of tools in itself I thought a post on it could be interesting.</p>
