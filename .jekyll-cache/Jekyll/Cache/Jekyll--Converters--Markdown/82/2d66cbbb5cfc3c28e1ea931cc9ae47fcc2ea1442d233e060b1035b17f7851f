I"<p>The way that ocean rendering is typically simulated in 3d rendering is using <strong>Gerstner Waves</strong>.
Unlike sine waves which will only displace the surface in the up axis (z), Gerstner Waves offer a physically accurate simulation of how individual waves actually flow, by also offsetting the other two axis.</p>

<p>You can see in the gif below how the vertices in the water plane move, with them getting more compact closer to the peaks, and less in the troths.</p>

<h3 id="core-parameters">Core Parameters</h3>

<p>Since Gerstner Waves are a physical calculation of waves, it means real world parameters can also be used.</p>

<p>The typical inputs for the gerstner function which are used here include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amplitude, the overall height of the wave (in Centimeters in this case)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steepness, which controls the “sharpness” of the wave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phase, the overall speed of the Gerstner Wave</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional-parameters">Additional Parameters</h3>

<p>And there are some additional parameters which I’ve added myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Direction, a direction vector for the flow of the wave (2 component to avoid expensive sin/cos calls for each function)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scale, an additional multiplier for the final wave to scale up/down from a single parameter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And on top of that, since it’s a wave we can combine multiple Gerstner Waves together, so I created a second function (creatively called) <strong>GerstnerWaves</strong>, which has a couple of extra inputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>WavesCount, the overall number of wave layers in the gerstner wave. Each new wave is double the frequency which results in a more finer amount of detail as the loops progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uniformity, where a value of 1.0 will result in all waves moving in the same direction, while lower to 0.0 will result in each layer going in a direction further away than the previous. This is good to alter how “random” the surface ends up looking.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scattering">Scattering</h3>

<p>On top of the other effects the shader includes a simulation of light scattering, while staying fully opaque.
It uses a single directional light source to simulate the light scatter when viewing parallel to the suns vector.</p>

<h3 id="sea-foam">Sea Foam</h3>
<p>Foam is an area that’s typically overlooked in some shaders, but found that even a subtle amount gives a nice effect. Unlike waves I couldn’t find a way of physically simulating this in realtime, so the way it is calculated uses some data from the Gerstner wave to create an ‘Amplitude Mask’.</p>

<p>The foam mask was created in Substance Designer, and is a 2 channel mask of Worley noise distorted into a fluid like mask. It uses the a texture phasing method (described below) to give a nice fluid effect.</p>

<h3 id="detailing-normals">Detailing Normals</h3>

<p>Although the waves themselves do a large part in the realism of the shader, without additional surface detailing they end up looking quite flat. To fix this I used 3 sets of normals at different frequencies (High for main body detailing, Medium for subtle waves and Low for lower frequency ripples and surface disturbance).</p>

<p>Normals alone tend to give a rather static and tiling look to the surface, so phasing between the textures in two states (similar to a flow map) also helps in avoiding this.</p>

<p>Although the Gerstner calculations themselves do a huge part in making the shader feel realistic, without any additional surface detailing you’ll find that they still end up looking extremely flat.</p>
