I"·<p>Asset Library is a series of pipeline tools I‚Äôve created for my own personal projects.</p>

<p>The main goals of these are to maximize the efficiency of bringing asset types from many DCC Packages to the final game.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs all a somewhat personal solution to my own project needs, and is constantly evolving, but since it‚Äôs starting to morph into a tangible set of tools I thought writing a post on it could be interesting.</p>

<p>This is a tool used to automatically export a material and all variants from Substance Designer to the Asset Library. When the exporter is ran, all textures are re-exported, and the .material file is updated with any edited parameters.</p>

<p>One of the nicest parts of the material pipeline is the ‚ÄúImport to Unreal Engine‚Äù sub-tool. Whevever this is ran, the current material is exported from Substance Designer, and reimported to Unreal with all of the new textures.</p>

<p>This means I no longer have to nagivate to the updated material and manually reimport all dependent textures. Instead it‚Äôs a single button press.</p>
