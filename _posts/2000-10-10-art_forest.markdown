Riverside camp in an Oak Forest, created in just over a week. 

Focusing on a more natural/non-hard surface environment for this piece.

The location went through a few iterations, but eventually I decided on a riverside, to give a more neutral time-frame and feel to the environment, and focus more on aesthetics.

A mix of Procedural materials (In Substance Designer) and Image-to-material (For Foliage/Leaves) was used throughout the scene.
