Soviet Era Mineshaft 3D Environment.

Based on a concept by James Dargie. Concept can be found here.

Responsible for all aspects of the scene.

My main focuses with this environment were to create a more grungey atmosphere, through the use of particles and vertex painted detailing, fitting with the overworked and unmanaged feels of both the concept and environments era.

Similar to the concept, I made sure to keep the obvious symbolism to a more subtle level, focusing more on the environmental detailing, with logos and symbols there when needed.

Spline tools were a great help in creating multiple areas of the environment. The rail-tracks and pipes were all created using instanced meshes to increase performance and iteration time.
