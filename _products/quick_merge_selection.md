### **Overview:**

Merge Selection is a tool for simply merging all objects currently selected.

It takes the process of merging down from `Set Selection -> Edit Mode -> Find Attach Button -> Attach` to just `Set Selection -> Merge Selection`.

This can save a tonne of time when working with many selections.

The tool currently works on Geometry and Splines.

### **Installing:**

Unzip the file to any desired location on your hard drive

In the 3DS Max menus, go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `install.py` script (in the root folder for the tool).


### **Running the Scripts (GUI):**

To run the scripts in GUI mode, in 3DS max go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `merge_selection_gui.ms` script (in the root folder for the tool).

This will launch a separate tool with interfaces for all 4 scripts. Just click the one you want and that's it!


### **Assigning Hotkeys:**

Macros are generated for quick running of all available scripts, including the GUI.

To assign a hotkey, in 3DS Max go to `Customize -> Hotkey Editor` and choose the category `FreeLime`. From there you should see macros for:

- Merge Selection (GUI)
- Merge Selection


### **Supported 3DS Max Versions:**

This script has been tested on 3DS Max 2022+, but should work on all versions from 2017 onward.

If you have any issues running the script, feel free to reach out and I'll do my best to assist.
